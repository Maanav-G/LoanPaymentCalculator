# Loan Payment Calculator
A loan payment calculator created during development training at IBM using WebSphere and Rational Software Architect as a Dojo-enable web application

The calculator accepts three pieces of input: loan amount, interest rate, and term. 
It outputs the monthly payment, a pie chart displaying the percentage of loan costs going towards principal and interest, and an amortization table. 
There is no submit button because the output fields are updated in real time as users enter or change input.
